## Core Functionality

At its core, this project takes a raw binary payload (e.g., shellcode in a `.bin` file), encrypts it using **AES-256**, and embeds the encrypted data into a C++ loader template. A C# builder application automates this process, applying multiple layers of obfuscation to the C++ source code before compiling it into a final executable (`loader.exe`).

When executed on a target machine, the loader does not simply decrypt and run the payload in its own memory. Instead, it uses a series of advanced techniques to evade detection by security products like Antivirus (AV) and Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) solutions.

## Key Features & Techniques

### AES-256 Payload Encryption

The primary function of the crypter is to hide the payload from static analysis. Static analysis involves scanning files on disk for known malicious signatures. By encrypting the payload, we transform it into random-looking data, making signature-based detection impossible.

-   **Algorithm:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with a 256-bit key (provided by the 16-byte key and 16-byte IV).
-   **Implementation:** The C# builder generates a random 16-byte key and a 16-byte Initialization Vector (IV) for each build. The payload is encrypted, and the resulting ciphertext, along with the IV, is embedded directly into the C++ loader's source code. The key is also embedded.
-   **Decryption:** At runtime, the loader uses an amalgamated, header-only AES implementation to decrypt the payload in memory just before injection. This ensures the decrypted, malicious payload never touches the disk on the target machine.

### Dynamic API Resolution via Hashing

To avoid leaving suspicious import entries in the final executable's Import Address Table (IAT), the loader resolves all required Windows API functions at runtime. Statically linking functions like `VirtualAllocEx` or `WriteProcessMemory` is a major red flag for security software.

-   **Technique:** Instead of storing function names as strings, we store 32-bit hashes of their names. The loader iterates through loaded modules (like `kernel32.dll`), calculates the hash of each exported function's name, and compares it to the target hash.
-   **Hash Function:** The project uses the **DJB2 hash algorithm**, a simple and effective non-cryptographic hashing function. A random 32-bit key is XORed with the final hash to prevent analysts from using pre-computed hash lookups (e.g., from a tool like `hashcat`).
-   **Benefits:**
    1.  **Stealth:** The final executable has a minimal and clean IAT, appearing much less suspicious.
    2.  **Anti-Analysis:** Reversing the loader is more difficult, as the analyst cannot immediately see which functions are being used. They must first understand the hashing algorithm and find the hash key.

### Parent Process ID (PPID) Spoofing

Many EDR solutions build process trees to monitor behavior. A process that suddenly spawns from an unexpected parent (e.g., `MicrosoftWord.exe` spawning `cmd.exe`) is highly suspicious. PPID Spoofing allows our loader to create a new process that appears to be a child of a legitimate, trusted process.

-   **Technique:** The loader first searches for a suitable parent process currently running on the system, such as `explorer.exe` (the Windows shell). It then uses the `UpdateProcThreadAttribute` function with the `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS` attribute to specify this legitimate process as the parent for a new process it is about to create.
-   **Execution Flow:**
    1.  Find and get a handle to a suitable parent process (e.g., `explorer.exe`).
    2.  Create a `STARTUPINFOEX` structure and initialize an attribute list.
    3.  Use `UpdateProcThreadAttribute` to add the parent process handle to the attribute list.
    4.  Call `CreateProcessW` with the `EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT` flag.
-   **Result:** The new sacrificial process (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `dllhost.exe`) is created, but in the system's process tree, it appears as a child of `explorer.exe`, which is a common and legitimate relationship. This breaks a common heuristic used for threat detection.

### Process Injection via Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APC)

Process injection is the method of forcing a separate process to execute our code. This project uses a stealthy technique known as APC Injection.

-   **Technique:** Every thread in Windows has a queue for Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APCs). These are functions that are scheduled to run when the thread enters an "alertable state."
-   **Execution Flow:**
    1.  A new process is created in a **suspended state** using `CREATE_SUSPENDED`. This gives us a process with a primary thread that is not yet executing code.
    2.  Memory is allocated within this new, suspended process using `VirtualAllocEx`.
    3.  The decrypted payload is written into this allocated memory with `WriteProcessMemory`.
    4.  `QueueUserAPC` is called to add the address of our payload to the APC queue of the suspended process's primary thread.
    5.  `ResumeThread` is called. As soon as the thread begins execution, it enters an alertable state and is immediately hijacked to execute our payload from the APC queue.
-   **Why it's stealthy:** This method is more subtle than classic injection techniques like `CreateRemoteThread`, as it doesn't involve creating a new, suspicious thread in the target process. It hijacks the main thread before it even has a chance to run its original code.

### Control-Flow Flattening

To further frustrate reverse engineering, the loader's API resolution logic is obfuscated using control-flow flattening.

-   **Concept:** A linear, easy-to-read sequence of `if/else` or `switch` statements is transformed into a more complex structure, typically involving a `while` loop and a state variable. The program's logic is broken into small blocks, and the `while` loop dispatches to the correct block based on the state variable.
-   **Implementation:** The `InitializeAPIs` function is implemented as a state machine. Each state resolves a single API function and then returns the index of the next state. A simple driver loop executes the states in order.
-   **Benefit:** This makes the code much harder to analyze with decompilers like IDA Pro or Ghidra. Instead of a clean function graph, the analyst sees a complex loop with many basic blocks, obscuring the true, linear logic of the program.

### Source Code Obfuscation

The C# builder also performs several string and name obfuscations on the C++ template before compilation.

-   **Randomized Names:** All header files, functions marked for obfuscation, and key variable names are renamed to random alphanumeric strings during each build. This prevents signature-based detection of the loader itself.
-   **Encrypted Stack Strings:** Critical strings (like process names for PPID spoofing) are not stored in the `.data` or `.rdata` sections of the executable. Instead, they are encrypted with a simple XOR key and reconstructed on the stack at runtime, character by character. This defeats basic string-dumping tools.

## Architectural Overview

### The C# Builder (`CrypterBuilder.exe`)

The builder is the orchestrator of the entire process. Its responsibilities include:
1.  **Payload Encryption:** Reads the raw payload, generates random AES keys, and performs the encryption.
2.  **Header Generation:** Creates a C++ header file (`payload_data.h`) containing the encrypted payload and keys.
3.  **Environment Setup:** Creates an isolated, temporary build directory and copies the C++ loader template source files into it.
4.  **Source Obfuscation:**
    *   Renames all `.h` and `.cpp` files to random names.
    *   Updates all `#include` directives to reflect the new random filenames.
    *   Replaces function and variable names with random strings.
    *   Injects the stack-string generation code.
5.  **Compilation:** Invokes the `g++` compiler with specific flags (`-s` to strip symbols, `-mwindows` for no console, etc.) to compile the final, obfuscated C++ source into a standalone `.exe`.

### The C++ Loader Template

This is the skeleton of the final executable. It contains placeholders (`{{PLACEHOLDER}}`) that the C# builder populates. Its key components are:
-   **API Hashing Engine:** The `GetFuncAddrByHash` function, which can find a function's address in memory using only its hash.
-   **State Machine:** The flattened `InitializeAPIs` function to securely resolve Windows APIs.
-   **Evasion Logic:** The `FindSuitableParentPID` and `CreateSpoofedProcess` functions for performing PPID spoofing.
-   **Injection Logic:** The `InjectViaApc` function for executing the payload.
-   **Main Entry Point:** The `main` function that ties all the pieces together in the correct order.

## How It Works: Step-by-Step

1.  The user runs `CrypterBuilder.exe <payload.bin> <template.cpp>`.
2.  The builder encrypts `payload.bin` and generates `payload_data.h`.
3.  It creates a temporary directory and obfuscates the C++ loader template source code.
4.  The builder replaces placeholders in the template with the obfuscated code and includes the `payload_data.h` header.
5.  It compiles the result into `loader.exe`.
6.  On the target, `loader.exe` is executed.
7.  It resolves all necessary WinAPI functions using hash lookups.
8.  It finds `explorer.exe` (or another suitable process) to use as a spoofed parent.
9.  It creates a new instance of a legitimate system process (like `svchost.exe`) in a suspended state, but with `explorer.exe` as its parent.
10. It decrypts the embedded payload in memory.
11. It allocates memory in the new suspended process, writes the payload there, and queues an APC pointing to the payload.
12. It resumes the new process's main thread. The thread immediately executes the APC, running the payload.
13. The `loader.exe` process exits cleanly, leaving the payload running in the memory of the spoofed, trusted process.

## Advanced Evasion & Anti-Analysis Techniques

To achieve a higher degree of evasion and remain undetected by security software and malware analysts, the loader employs a comprehensive suite of anti-analysis techniques. These checks are designed to detect and thwart common debugging, sandboxing, and automated analysis environments. The philosophy is simple: if the loader suspects it is being analyzed, it will terminate immediately rather than revealing its payload.

These checks are orchestrated by the `PerformAntiAnalysisChecks` function, which uses a **Scoring System**. Each detected anomaly adds points to a `detection_points` counter. If the counter exceeds a `threshold`, the loader exits. This prevents a single, potentially false-positive check from terminating the program, making the detection more robust and reliable.

### 1. Anti-Debugging

This category focuses on detecting whether a debugger is attached to the loader's process. Debugging is the primary method an analyst uses to step through code and understand its behavior.

-   **PEB `BeingDebugged` Flag:** The most common check. The `IsDebuggerPresent()` WinAPI function is often hooked by security tools. To bypass this, we directly access the **Process Environment Block (PEB)** in memory. The PEB contains a byte-sized flag, `BeingDebugged`, which the OS sets to `1` when a debugger is attached. We check this flag manually via `__readgsqword(0x60)` on x64 systems.

-   **Remote Debugger Check:** Uses the `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent()` API. While still an API call, it's less commonly hooked than `IsDebuggerPresent` and is essential for detecting debuggers that are attached from another machine or process.

-   **Hardware Breakpoints:** Debuggers use special CPU registers (`Dr0` through `Dr3`) to set hardware breakpoints, which are very difficult for a program to detect. Our loader reads the current thread's context using `GetThreadContext` and directly checks if any of these debug registers are non-zero. If they are, it's a very high-confidence indicator of an active debugger.

-   **Timing Anomalies:** When a debugger is attached and stepping through code, the execution time is significantly distorted. This check measures the time it takes for a `Sleep(500)` call to complete. In a normal environment, this will take approximately 500 milliseconds. In a debugger, as the analyst steps over the function, the elapsed time will be much longer. This detects manual analysis.

### 2. Anti-Virtualization & Sandbox Evasion

Automated security tools execute suspicious files in isolated virtual machines (VMs) or sandboxes to observe their behavior. These checks aim to identify the artificial nature of these environments.

-   **Known VM Artifacts (Hardware):**
    -   **Disk & Graphics Drivers:** Uses the `SetupDiGetClassDevsA` API to enumerate hardware devices. It specifically looks for device IDs containing strings like `"qemu"`, `"vbox"`, `"vmware"`, or `"virtualbox"`. The presence of these indicates well-known hypervisors.
    -   **MAC Address:** Scans the MAC addresses of the system's network adapters. Virtualization platforms like VMware and VirtualBox use specific OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) prefixes for their virtual network cards (e.g., `00:05:69`, `00:0C:29`, `08:00:27`). The loader checks against a list of these known VM prefixes.
    -   **KVM Drivers:** Specifically checks for the existence of known Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) driver files in `System32\drivers`, such as `vioinput.sys` or `netkvm.sys`.

-   **Hypervisor CPU Flag:** Modern CPUs have a virtualization extension. The `__cpuid` instruction can be used to query CPU features. A specific bit (the "hypervisor present" bit at position 31 of the ECX register after calling leaf `1`) is set if the code is running under a hypervisor. This is a very reliable low-level check.

-   **Common Sandbox Usernames:** Many sandboxes use default or generic usernames like `"Sandbox"`, `"maltest"`, `"CurrentUser"`, or `"WDAGUtilityAccount"`. The loader retrieves the current username via `GetUserNameA` and checks it against a blacklist of these common, non-human names.

-   **Small Screen Resolution:** Automated sandboxes often run headless (without a real display) and default to small, legacy screen resolutions like 800x600. The loader calls `GetSystemMetrics` to check the screen size. If it's below a realistic modern threshold, it's considered suspicious.

---

### 3. Behavioral & Environmental Checks

These checks look for signs of a real, interactive user and a normal operating environment, which are often absent in an analysis sandbox.

-   **Human Activity Check:** This is a powerful behavioral check. The loader records the mouse cursor's position at the start. It then enters a loop, periodically checking the cursor's position again. If the mouse has not moved after a significant period (e.g., 5 minutes), it assumes no human is present and terminates. An automated sandbox will almost never simulate realistic mouse movement.

-   **Internet Connectivity:** Some sandboxes intentionally block or redirect internet access to prevent a malicious payload from connecting to its C2 server. The loader attempts a simple TCP connection to a highly-available public DNS server (Google's `8.8.8.8` on port `53`). If this basic connection fails, it's a strong indicator of a restricted or offline analysis environment.
